Changelog:
=========================================
2020-03-04:
    [+] Added shiny Pokemon tracking (separate from regular
        Pokemon tracking).
    [+] Added several new commands:
        -> add_shiny (alias: as)
            => Adds a new shiny Pokemon to be tracked
        -> display_pokemon (alias: display [args])
            => Displays an embed with a user's tracked
               Pokemon. Currently the 'all' modifier is
               locked to the bot owner (Knifesurge#1723
               and Carlos94563#0697)
        -> remove_pokemon (alias: rp)
            => Removes a tracked Pokemon. This cannot be 
               reversed!
        -> remove_shiny_pokemon (alias: rs)
            => Removes a tracked shiny Pokemon. This cannot
               be reversed!
    [~] Modified the bot owner restrictions to the restart, 
        shutdown, and certain modifiers to the display 
        command. This is implemented with a 
        is_admin(user_id:str)->bool function.
    [~] Put the tracked-pokemon and shiny-pokemon filenames
        into some global constants to allow easier changing 
        of names if so desired later on.
